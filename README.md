This is a small project Iâ€™m building to help me track the reading progress of my book club.

I used to keep this information in a Notion page, but I wanted something a bit more structured â€” and also an opportunity to practice with Python, data cleaning, and simple dashboards.

The idea is to:
- Store details about books, members, and sessions (maybe in a CSV or SQLite for now)
- Write some logic to organize and clean the data
- Create a basic dashboard to visualize things like:
  - Whoâ€™s reading what
  - Which genres are popular
  - Completion rates
  - How we vote or choose next books

Letâ€™s see how far I get â€” I want to keep this lightweight but useful.
