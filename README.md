# ðŸ“š Buchblick â€“ Book Club Dashboard

**Buchblick** is a personal data project built to track and analyze activities from my book club. What started as a Notion page is now a lightweight app that helps me manage our club's book data, track attendance, and visualize yearly stats â€“ all while learning tools relevant to data roles.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ“– Track books read, genres, themes, and meeting dates
- ðŸ‘¥ Manage member attendance and book suggestions
- ðŸ“Š Dashboard view for stats like total pages read, top attendees, and most active suggesters
- âž• Add new books directly via the app
- ðŸ’¡ Built with reusability and potential for future automation and analytics

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- `Python`
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `Streamlit` for the dashboard interface
- `Git` for version control and project tracking

## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/schardot/bookclub-data-pipeline
cd buchblick
```

2. Install dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Ideas
- Add login or member views

- Voting interface for future book picks

- Year-end wrap-up summary (Spotify Wrapped-style)

- Deploy app for shared club use

This project is actively growing. It's both a personal tool and a showcase of my data skills!
